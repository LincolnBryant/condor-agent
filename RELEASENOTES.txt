Condor Agent Release Notes
==========================

Release 1.15
------------
Added:
* Committed a new RELEASENOTES.txt document to the repository, included in final packages


Fixed:
* Drop the mglob dependency
  It was annoying and not overly useful. Replaced it with a glob+isfile check that does just
  as well.

* Case 7355: Encode the scheduler name in the cluster file on disk to avoid file clashes
  Without the scheduler name included in the file name it's possible that duplicate cluster
  IDs will occur for a multi-scheduler machine which would would mean proxy submission
  .cluster files would clash.

* Omit a \n when returning the cluster ID for a successful submission
  The body of the response on success should just be the cluster ID, no newline
  character required.

* Ensure submission cleaner thread doesn't die
  On startup the thread checks for CONDOR_AGENT_SUBMIT_DIR -- if this isn't defined
  the Agent shouldn't let the cleaner thread exit. Instead it should just warn that
  it's not doing cleanup at this point in time and sleep as it usually does.
